Problem 2.	Paragraphs and Images of Text
Create an HTML page holding a few headings, each with a few paragraphs of text. Insert a few images. Play with the old formatting tags <b>, <i>, <u>, <strong>, <em>, <sup>, <sub>, <pre>, <br /> etc. Ensure you have <doctype>, <html>, <head>, <title> and <body>.
